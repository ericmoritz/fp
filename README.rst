**Goals**

 * Provide the functions to make compositions of functions using
   `partial` and `compose` seen often in FP easier.
 * Provide a collection of useful predicates and operator functions to
   use with higher-order functions
 * Provide a collection of common higher-order functions usually
   bundled with functional languages
 * Provide a common interface to existing tools that makes using
   partials with higher-order functions more natural
 * Provide a collection of Monads that are helpful for Python development
