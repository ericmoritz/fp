This project aims to build a standard collection of functional
programming inspired tools to Python.

# Goals

 * Provide the functions to make compositions of functions using
   `partial`, `compose` and `thrush` seen often in FP.
 * Provide a collection of useful predicates and operator functions to
   use with higher-order functions
 * Provide a collection of common higher-order functions usually
   bundled with functional languages
 * Provide a common interface to existing tools that makes using
   partials with higher-order functions more natural
